## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud-First Architecture

This application is built entirely on cloud infrastructure, primarily through the **Base44 platform**, ensuring high availability, automatic scaling, and enterprise-grade security:

### **Backend as a Service (BaaS)**
- **Cloud Database**: All entities (Listings, Users, Trades, Messages) are stored in managed cloud databases with automatic scaling and backup
- **Authentication**: Secure user management with Google OAuth integration, handled entirely in the cloud
- **File Storage**: Images and uploads stored in cloud-based object storage with global CDN distribution

### **Serverless Computing**
- **Functions**: All backend logic runs as serverless functions that automatically scale based on demand
- **Zero Infrastructure Management**: No servers to provision, maintain, or monitor
- **Pay-per-use**: Only pay for actual compute time used

### **Cloud Integrations**
- **AI Services**: OpenAI integration for smart suggestions and content moderation
- **Email Services**: Cloud-based email delivery for notifications
- **Image Processing**: Cloud-powered image analysis and optimization
- **Voice Processing**: Serverless voice-to-text conversion for hands-free search
